# Rogue JS

This project is a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) "game" made using React!

The quotes around the word game are meant as a joke, because in the current state it's technically a game but it's bare bones

It's a hobby project that I've worked and reworked and restarted many many times for practicing programming and general fun.

As is what have I implemented already 
- The game board works 
- Initial board state extracted from the `map1.json` file in the `public/maps` folder
- State machine that controls turns
- Rudimentary "AI" and combat
- Player and enemy death

## Running the "game"

Just run `npm install` and `npm start` and the project will start itself
