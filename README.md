# Rogue JS

This project is a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game made using React!
It's a hobby project that I've worked and reworked and restarted many many times for practicing programming and general fun

## Running the "game"

As a react project, just run `npm install` and `npm start` and the project will start itself, the quotes around the word game are meant as a joke, because in the current state it's technically a game but it's bare bones
